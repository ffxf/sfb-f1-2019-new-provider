# sfb-f1-2019-new-provider
SimfeedBack provider for F1 2019 (and F1 2018) new UDP format

Before you start, be sure you have F1-2019 or F1-2018 set to use the new UDP format (F1-2019 or F1-2018 respectively). The current version assumes the standard UDP port 20777 of F1-2018 and F1-2019.

See [releases](https://github.com/ffxf/sfb-f1-2019-new-provider/releases) for installable files.

## Status

The provider only has been tested with F1-2018 thus far although it should work with F1-2019 as well
